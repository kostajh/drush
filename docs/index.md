Drush
=====

[Drush](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush) is a command line shell and Unix scripting interface for [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). Drush core ships with lots of useful commands for interacting with code like modules/themes/profiles. Similarly, it runs update.php, executes sql queries and DB migrations, and misc utilities like run cron or clear cache. Drush can be extended by 3rd party command files.
